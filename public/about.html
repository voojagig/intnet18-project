				Welcome to <i>Chatty McChatface</i>, the chattiest of systems at KTH
			</p>

			<p>
        Now, this is a story all about how<br>
        My life got flipped-turned upside down<br>
        And I'd like to take a minute<br>
        Just sit right there<br>
        I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air<br>
        <br>
        In west Philadelphia born and raised<br>
        On the playground was where I spent most of my days<br>
        Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br>
        And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school<br>
        When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br>
        Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br>
        I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
        She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air'<br>
        <br>
        I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br>
        The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror<br>
        If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br>
        But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, home to Bel-Air'<br>
        <br>
        I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br>
        And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home smell ya later'<br>
        I looked at my kingdom<br>
        I was finally there<br>
        To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air<br>
